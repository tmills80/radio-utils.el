;;; Commentary:

;; radio-utils is a collection of utilities I have written for using and logging my radio
;; listening and ham radio activities in Emacs
;; The log file is an org-mode file, radio control is achieved using rigctl from Hamlib


;;; Code:

;;;; Requirements

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'org)

;;;; Customization
